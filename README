xCAT-cisco is a plugin to allow xCAT hardware management 
commands (like rpower, rinv, etc) to run on the Cisco UCS platform.  

xCAT (Extreme Cloud Administration Toolkit) is an open source 
hardware tool used to provision physical and virtual machines 
with proven scalability.  In addition to provisioning methods it provides
methods to manipulate and query hardware, including getting information from 
management interfaces (like IPMI, other vendor blades, etc).

Think of it this way:  Every hardware vendor sells/packages some sort of management 
solution to manage their hardware:  IBM - Director, HP - Insight, 
Dell - something else, ... etc.  xCAT is a way to manage all hardware.

For more information on xCAT see: http://xcat.sf.net

Installation instructions:

When this is complete, there will be an RPM that you should see on this page. Simply download
the RPM and install it *after* you have installed xCAT.
